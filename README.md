# Survey-Form
The survey form is created using HTML and CSS to design the layout and visual appearance of the form.
When a user visits the survey form page, they see a series of input fields, labels, and other elements that prompt them to provide information in response to the survey questions.
Users can interact with the form by typing responses into the input fields or selecting options from dropdown menus or radio buttons.
As the user fills out the form, the input data is stored in the form's HTML code, ready to be submitted to the server.
